In this project, we propose a system where we use machine learning classification models to classify insincere questions on Quora. Supervised learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble Model and state-of-art algorithms such as BERT and Roberta are implemented for this binary classification problem.
